CLIENT-SERVER MODEL

Client -- start the comunication and make a request to the srver
Server -- make the response for the client

There can be many clients

If the client doesn´t exists, nothing happens BUT if there is no server, the client doesn´t receive a response (nothing works)

The client and the server are running in a computer but there can be more programs inside the computer. The client and the server can
be running inside theh same computer.
The client and the server are comunicated through internet. Inside internet there are isolated computers connected in networks. With the IP
addres computers are connected and identified. the computer can have several ones. (IP---Addres than can change depending where are you connected)

- My phone ID addres at URJC is: 10.0.54.95
- ID of the computer: 212.128.253.78
- ID of the teacher: 212.128.253.64

Ping for know if the computer 'is alive'. We send messages to the computer.
EX
---- ping time to 8.8.8.8:
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=121 time=3.21 ms

---- ping time of my computer:
64 bytes from 212.128.253.78: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.065 ms

---- ping of other computer:
64 bytes from 212.128.253.77: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.600 ms

---- ping time of my mobile:
64 bytes from 10.0.54.95: icmp_seq=1 ttl=62 time=14.5 ms

URL -- identifying a computer interface for humans
There are special servers (DNS) that make a transformation between the URL and the IP adres
EX. the IP addres of wwww.google.com is: 216.58.214.164
    ping of www.URJC.es is: 212.128.240.50

The port is a number that identify any available app (there is a lot of apps in the same computer) that can communicate to the server. The web server usually is the 80
TO CONNECT THE SERVER WE NEED THE ID ADDRES AND THE PORT
